# Formula 1 Dataset Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a comprehensive dataset containing Formula 1 racing data from 1953 to present. The dataset includes information on drivers, constructors, race results, lap times, pit stops, and more. The goal of this project is to explore the dataset, gain insights into Formula 1 racing history, and create impactful visualizations.

## Dataset Source
After extensive data cleaning and manipulation, I publisheed my first dataset on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/suletanmay/formula-1-dataset-1950-2023-cleaned?rvi=1
The dataset was sourced from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/formula-1-world-championship-1950-2020 which was compiled from http://ergast.com/mrd/ and consists of 14 Excel sheets, each representing a different aspect of Formula 1 racing (e.g., circuits, constructors, driver standings, race results, etc.).

## Tools and Technologies Used
- Python for data cleaning, preprocessing, and analysis
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly for data visualization
- Tableau for creating interactive and dynamic dashboards

## Project Objectives
1. Conduct historical performance analysis of drivers and constructors.
2. Analyze race results, qualifying performances, and pit stop strategies.
3. Explore the impact of circuit characteristics and race conditions on race outcomes.
4. Develop statistical models to predict race outcomes and driver standings.

## Data Cleaning and Preparation
- Imported the dataset into 14 different Pandas DataFrames, each representing a different aspect of Formula 1 racing.
- Cleaned the data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.

## Data Analysis and Visualization
- Analyzed the data using Pandas to derive insights and identify trends.
- Created visualizations using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly to visualize the data effectively.
- Used Tableau to build interactive dashboards for exploring the data dynamically.

## Inspiration 
- “If you no longer go for a gap that exists, you're no longer a racing driver.” - Ayrton Senna

## Conclusion
This project aims to provide valuable insights into Formula 1 racing history and performance, showcasing the power of data analysis and visualization in uncovering meaningful patterns and trends.
